# SigmaBooks

This is the project for my coding test. 

The .rar file contains an executable along with files required to run the program. Run the .exe and go to https://localhost:5001. Since the certificate is selfsigned the browser might not like it, but it should be fine.

The code is contained in the TodoAPI folder.


Hope that works!
